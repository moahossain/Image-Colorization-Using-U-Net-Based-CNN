# Image-Colorization-Using-U-Net-Based-CNN
This repository contains the code and resources to automatically colorize grayscale images using a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project combines techniques like Neural Style Transfer (NST) and Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) to generate realistic and high-quality colorized images.
